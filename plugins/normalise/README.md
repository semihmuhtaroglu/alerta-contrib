Normalise Plugin (Example)
==========================

This is an example plugin that demonstrates how plugins can be used
to "normalise" alerts from different monitoring sources to ensure
they conform to a standard before being saved to the database.

Normalise actions:

  * two alert attributes are checked for values and if no value is set they are assigned default values.
  * alert text is modified to prepend the severity level in capitals.

This repo should be forked or copied and the python plugin modified to suit
the specific Alerta environment.

Installation
------------

Clone the GitHub repo and run:

    $ python setup.py install

Or, to install remotely from GitHub run:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/alerta/alerta-contrib.git#subdirectory=plugins/normalise

Note: If Alerta is installed in a python virtual environment then plugins
need to be installed into the same environment for Alerta to dynamically
discover them.

Configuration
-------------

Add `normalise` to the list of enabled `PLUGINS` in `alertad.conf` server
configuration file and set plugin-specific variables either in the
server configuration file or as environment variables.

**Example**

```python
PLUGINS = ['reject','normalise']
```

Troubleshooting
---------------

Restart Alerta API and confirm that the plugin has been loaded and enabled.

Set `DEBUG=True` in the `alertad.conf` configuration file and look for log
entries similar to below:
